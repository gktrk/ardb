As it's extremely tedious for me to track bugs through multiple emails
and forums, if you want to submit a bug report, please use this link:
http://code.google.com/p/ardb/issues/list

Also, as a general guideline, please include the full text of the
error you get, your email address so I can contact you for more details
and which steps one should perform to reproduce the error. 
If the bug is about messed up display or other graphical problem,
please include a http link to a screenshot of the bug.
Thanks.
