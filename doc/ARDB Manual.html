<h2>Card Browser window (main window)</h2>
<br>
Each tab in the window is a different browser.<br>
<br>
You start with two of them (one for the crypt, one for the library) and
ALL cards in the browsers.
<br>
<br>
The "Select", "Add" and "Remove" buttons are filters. First, use
"Select" to focus your search. Then you can use "Add" and "Remove",
which should be self-explanatory.
<br>
<br>
There's only one search per tab. To have multiple simultaneous
searches, click the various "New [whatever] browser" in the "Browser"
menu.
<br>
<br>
The green boxes that appear along the top border are reminders of the
filters you've applied. They're like the stack of filters in Photoshop
or the GIMP. The order of these filters is important : they're applied
from left to right. You can manipulate them with a right-click which
brings a popup menu.
<br>
<br>
Left clicking the colum names of the card list allows you to sort the
results.
<br>
<br>
Typing a card's name in the "Find" textfield will highlight this card
in the list. This "Find" function has spellchecking which allows for
one typo.
<br>
<br>
Right clicking a card in the list pops up a menu. Double clicking it
adds this card to the current deck.<br>
<br>
Multiple selection of cards or filters is allowed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Deck Builder window</h2>
There are 3 tabs : deck information, crypt and library.<br>
<br>
Deck information is simple, just fill the form.<br>
<br>
The crypt tab allows you to pick vampires to add in your deck. They'll
appear in the bottom list. Before adding each vampire, you may also
choose the vampire's edition and "Advanced" status.<br>
<br>
As a visual clue, some vampires in your crypt list may show up in red.
This is because they violate the crypt grouping rule. Right clicking
vampires in this list brings up a popup menu.<br>
<br>
The Happy Families calculator is located in the top right corner, and
may serve as a deckbuilding help to good cardflow.<br>
<br>
Instead of the Happy Families calculator, you may opt to display the
vampire's cardtext, useful if you're not familiar with the cards.<br>
<br>
The library tab allows you to add library cards for your deck. Your
deck is displayed as a tree on the right side. Right clicking cards in
this tree brings up a popup menu.<br>
<br>
As a deckbuilding help, the bottom left area may display a library
overview of how many cards of each kind are being used, or you may
choose to use this space as a card text reminder.<br>
<br>
The File menu of the Deck Builder window has all the classical file
operations (open, save, export).<br>
The Tools menu includes Merge Deck (use this for including pre built
modules in your current deck), and Draw Simulator (shuffles your deck
and simulates your first hand and uncontrolled region).<br>
<br>
<h2>FAQ, FGA</h2>
Q: My deck morphed! Cards are completely random!<br>
A: In previous releases of ARDB, a failed database update (the
Anthelios bug for example) would lead to a messed up but functional
database. All decks built with such a messed up database are messed up
decks. I'm sorry about that.
Now ARDB will cancel the changes and revert to a sane database if
anything goes wrong during the update.<br>
<br>
Q: I want Master cards to be listed before everything else in my deck
lists.<br>
A: ARDB now comes with "Masters First" templates (*mf.xsl). Please
tweak your ARDB.INI configuration file so that ARDB uses these new
templates. It should be very straightforward. A graphical means of
doing this <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> appear in
the future, but it's not a priority right now. <br>
<br>
Q: I still don't like the way ARDB exports decks.<br>
A: Write your own template then, or tweak the existing ones. For
example, changing colors in the HTML export template should be pretty
easy if you know a little about HTML and CSS.<br>
<br>
Q: Your deckbuilder doesn't work on Windows 95/98.<br>
A: True. ARDB is based on fairly recent technologies, like Unicode.
Windows 95/98 don't have proper Unicode support. They're too old. Or
they're not good enough, I don't know. Either way, they're no longer
supported by Microsoft anyway, so I fail to see why <span
 style="font-style: italic;">I</span> would support them. You should
probably upgrade to a better system... May I suggest MacOS or Linux? :)<br>
<br>
Q: There's a bug when...<br>
A: Please submit a proper bug report at 
<a

Q: This help file... isn't very helpful. It isn't pretty either.<br>
