<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Cross compiler, headers, import libs </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Downloading the build script</A>
</H2>

<P>Create a bootstrap directory used to hold downloaded files and bootstrap
the MinGW build. 
<P>I used:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
/usr/local/src/minGW-boot
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>cd to that directory and fetch the build-cross.sh script. I used wget but
a browser works too. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
wget http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/build-cross.sh
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a great script -- nicely structured, quite readable and has reasonable
sanity checks. It needs wget to work without bypassing the download section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Configuring the environment</A>
</H2>

<P>Edit the script and near the top change the TARGET and PREFIX variables.
I used the following. The PREFIX is where all the binaries, headers and libraries
are installed. Remember the PREFIX path and TARGET, you'll need it later when
configuring wxWindows. 
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
# what flavor are we building? 
TARGET=i586-mingw32msvc 
# where does it go? 
PREFIX=/usr/local/src/minGW 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Don't use /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin as the PREFIX as important(non-windows?!)
files may be overwritten. Cross compilers typically need to be in their own
little lock box. 
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Downloading, compiling and installing</A>
</H2>

<P>Save the file and run it. It downloads all the needed projects, configures
them, makes them, and does a safe install to an area located in the $PREFIX
tree. After doing so much grunt work and doing it so well it suddenly lies
to you and says 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Installation complete! 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Don't believe it. For the wxWindows build to go smoothly you need to change
to root (su or su - depending on your distro) and copy most of the compiler
and linker binaries in $PREFIX/bin to a directory in your $PATH.
Don't worry. They all have $TARGET prefixed to their name so that gcc
is actually named i586-mingw32msvc-gcc and shouldn't overwrite your gcc if
there's one there. I used 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cp -i /usr/local/src/minGW/bin/i586* /usr/local/bin 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Testing the cross-compiler</A>
</H2>

<P>Now you can test your MinGW set up. Create a &quot;hello world&quot; program:
hello.cpp 
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main()
{
    printf(&quot;hello world\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Type in the command: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
i586-mingw32msvc-gcc -v hello.cpp -o hello.exe 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The -v will show you that the new cross-compiler is looking in all the
right places for the stuff it needs. Now try to run the program hello.exe and
you get
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
: bash: ./hello.exe: cannot execute binary file 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Congratulations! You just tried to run a windows program on Linux and got
the expected response. If you have WINE installed you might copy the .exe to
a WINE recognized directory and type &quot;wine hello.exe&quot;. If wine doesn't
cover it up with all it's configuration complaints you'll see your &quot;hello
world&quot; at the end. 
<P>Copy the .exe to a windows machine and run it from a command window (dos
prompt). It should work fine. 
<P>So much for console based apps -- now for the GUI stuff.
