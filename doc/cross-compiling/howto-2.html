<H2><A NAME="s2">2. wxWindows headers, source, and libs </A></H2>

<P>If you haven't gotten the hello.exe to in PART I to compile and run then
don't bother going any further until you get that fixed. 
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Getting the wxWindows source</A>
</H2>

<P>Download the latest wxWindows source for WINDOWS from http://www.wxWindows.org
Get the plain old wxMSW-2.4.0.zip. The wxMSW-2.4.0-setup.zip package has a
setup.exe program that unpacks the files from .cab archive. WINE may handle
this but I didn't bother to find out. Remember this source code is for the
windows platform. 
<P>Unpack it in your usual package build location, I use /usr/local/src. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cd /usr/local/src 
unzip &lt;your download dir&gt;/wxMSW-2.4.0.zip 
cd wxWindows-2.4.0 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Invalid token trouble! -- Maybe...</A>
</H2>

<P>Now for a bit of ugliness that you may not have to deal with ? nobody else
mentions this in the resources I found. When I started the build I got a pot
full of compiler errors something about &quot;invalid token found...&quot;
etc. Oddly enough my new cross-compiler really hates linefeeds at the end of
a line and all the wxWindows files are in the old dos CR/LF format. BUMMER!
<P>
<P>On SuSE there is a utility (actually an alias) called dos2Unix. It will
strip the LFs in a file in place and leaves a nice unix type file. It's actually
an alias around recode and is defined thus: 
<P>alias dos2unix='recode ibmpc..lat1' 
<P>I converted the needed files with these commands: 
<P>
<PRE>
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.h&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.env&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.c&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.cpp&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.cxx&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.y&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.l&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.rsrc&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.in&quot;` 
dos2unix `find . -name &quot;*.am&quot;`

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Making multiple target configurations</A>
</H2>

<P>At this point you need to make some decisions. Typically in the windows
development world you have multiple configurations -- Debug Static, Debug DLL,
Release Static, Release DLL -- are the usual suspects. The docs say that .dlls
library versions (shared libs) are not supported but I made them anyway and
they work fine under WINE and windows. Your mileage may vary. 
<P>For reasons buried deep in this project's configure and make system you
cannot INSTALL multiple configurations of the wxWindows library ? They are
named the same and will overwrite each other. You can, however MAKE multiple
configurations -- just don't install them using &quot;make install&quot;. 
<P>The section in ./wxWindows-2.4.0/docs/msw/install.txt on multiple configurations
gives some background on the problem. I guess you could manually rename them
copy then manually and change each wx-config script to match -- not pretty.
If you want to replay me for this howto, figure out how to easily use multiple
configurations, write a howto and send it to me. TIA. 
<P>Lets say you want a static lib debug version. 
<P>Remember your current working directory is /usr/local/src/wxWindows-2.4.0.
Make a subdirectory to build your specific configuration. You may have as many
of these subdirectories for as many different configurations you want to create.
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mkdir static-debug 
cd static-debug 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now you need to invoke the configure script (in the parent directory ../configure)
with the configure options for this subdirectory build. I used a homemade script
for this. It turned out that it saved a lot of typing for multiple configurations.
Of course you DID remember the PREFIX and TARGET I told you to to in PART I?
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh 
# use the $TARGET you edited in the minGW build-cross.sh 
TARGET=i586-mingw32msvc 
BUILD=MinGW-wxWinDebugStatic 
# use the $PREFIX you edited in the minGW build-cross.sh 
MINGWBASE=/usr/local/src/minGW 
MINGWTARG=/usr/local/src/minGW/$TARGET 
PREFIX=$MINGWBASE/$BUILD 
echo &quot;be sure that $TARGET-gcc is in the path&quot; 

../configure \ 
--prefix=$PREFIX \ 
--build=$BUILD \ 
--target=$BUILD \ 
--host=$TARGET \ 
--with-msw \ 
--libdir=$MINGWTARG/lib \ 
--includedir=$MINGWTARG/include \ 
--enable-debug \ 
--enable-debug_gdb \ 
--disable-shared \ 

# for debug dll replace the last three with these 
# --enable-debug \ 
# --enable-debug_gdb \ 
# --enable-shared \

# for release static replace the last three with these 
# --disable-debug \ 
# --disable-shared \

# for release dll replace the last three with these 
# --disable-debug \ 
# --enable-shared \ 
# end of script
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Invoke the above modified script and wait for configure to finish. Now
type 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
make
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The build will take a long time. You can ignore the previously declared
warnings. After make completes don't do the "make install" step if you want multiple
configurations. There will be a wx-config link that you can invoke to get the
flags and paths needed in your own application projects. 
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Testing wxWindows</A>
</H2>

<P>To test
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cd samples 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Pick one of the sample projects, cd to it and type "make". You should get
a .exe that you can copy to a windows machine and run or run on Linux using
WINE.
