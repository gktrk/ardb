Hi All, 

The Windows version of Ardb Version 3.0.0 is available for 
download. 

This version: 

  - Adds the cards for Heirs to the Blood.
  - Adds multiple card browser support
  - Adds automatic update of out of date card database
    on start up
  - Adds download card images option to the File menu

Notes:

If you have an "Anarch Revolt Deck Builder" directory in your user
directory you will need to delete it to make sure the correct ardb.ini file
and cardimages are used.

You can disable the automatic card database check using Preferences
option on the File menu.

The way in which ardb handles card images has been changed.  To use
card images you will need to either:

     1. Download the new card zip files using the 
     	File | Download	Images option and select the 
	card sets to download  
	
	or

     2. Create the image zip files yourself from local card
        images.  Ardb expects to find a directory called cardimages
	in the directory it is installed in.  Inside this
	directory it expects to find a zip file for each set.
	The name of the zip files are <set abbreviation>.zip i.e
	Heirs to the Blood images are found in the file 
	httb.zip.  If you have the old cardimages directory just
	zip up each of the card set sub directories (without paths) 
	and save them under the cardimages directory.
